ABSTRACT = {The lack of publicly available up-to-date datasets contributes to the difficulty in evaluating intrusion detection systems. This paper introduces HIKARI-2021, a dataset that contains encrypted synthetic attacks and benign traffic. This dataset conforms to two requirements: the content requirements, which focus on the produced dataset, and the process requirements, which focus on how the dataset is built. We compile these requirements to enable future dataset developments and we make the HIKARI-2021 dataset, along with the procedures to build it, available for the public.},
